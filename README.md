# PyBuses

A Python framework for managing bus stops and incoming buses. The idea is to use on Telegram Bots for Bus services and other public transport platforms.

This project is currently **Work In Progress**, but I will ocasionally upload code updates on the [wip branch](https://github.com/EnforcerZhukov/PyBuses/tree/wip), so please, check it out! You can also see the [old branch](https://github.com/EnforcerZhukov/PyBuses/tree/old).
